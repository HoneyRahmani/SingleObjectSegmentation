# Single Object Segmentation- Segmentation of the Fetal Head in ultrasound images- Pytorch
## About the Project
This project focuses on developing a deep-learning model using PyTorch to outline the boundary of one target object in an image by a binary mask. Thus, task is single-object segmentation and goal is to predict a binary mask.
In this project, automatically segmenting a fetal head in ultrasound image is performed.
